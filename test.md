Requirements Document -- Team 22
================================

1 User Requirements
-------------------

### 1.1 Software Interfaces

List all the external systems with which the software product interacts. These are external systems/libraries that you have to interact with.

### 1.2 User Interfaces

1.2.1. User specifies delimiters using –d argument

1.2.2. User specifies word length using –l argument

1.2.3. User specifies file path

1.2.4. Output average sentence length, rounded out to the nearest integer

Specify the logical characteristics of each interface between the software product and its users. This is a description of how the system will interact with its users.

### 1.3 User Characteristics

Describe those general characteristics of the intended users of the product, including educational level, experience, and technical expertise.

2 System Requirements
---------------------

2.0.1. Vanilla Java 1.8. No outside libraries will be used

2.0.2. Execute from the command line. Java console application

2.0.3. Compile with Javac, no options

These subsections contain all the software requirements at a level of detail sufficient to enable designers/developers to design/develop a system that satisfies those requirements, and testers to test that the system satisfies those requirements. This part of the document should provide a numbered (possibly hierarchical) list of simple, complete, and consistent functional and non-functional requirements.

### 2.1 Functional Requirements

2.1.1 The comma is not to be used as a default sentence delimiter

2.1.2 ":" is a sentence delimiter

2.1.2 "." is a sentence delimiter

### 2.2 Non-Functional Requirements
